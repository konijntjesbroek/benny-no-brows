Thanks, Pat.

I wanted to build a bot/trainer that would allow multiple rpg systms to be 
played by way of slcack. Was torn between Doc Brown and Ben. They are very 
similar characters and not unlike a host of scientists/explorers I have know
more driven by curiosity than self-preservation and much better with an
audience.
